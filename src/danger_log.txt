#####Exception Guarantee#########
Basic Exception Guarantee
#####Danger Log###########
1. Transmission Error:
Occurs when receiving large amount of data from the websites, the proxy may not rececive all the transmitted bytes in one go
Our Solution: use a while loop to wait until no more transmission is made, meanwhile attach every message received in to a new buffer

2.Cache Size
Since we store the cached request into the memory, too many cached request may cause memory overflow
Our solution: max cache size limited to 100 responses, new cache will replace the existing ones when the map is full

3.Cache in multiprocessing
multiple processes may want to write into the cache at the same time, causing data races
Our solution: Using mutex lock to lock the map while one process is writing

4. Invalid request format
Browser constanly sending ill-formatted request which the proxy is not designed to handle
Possible soution: config the browser to stop it from sending such request, set up rules in our proxy to ignore such requests

5. Closing Tunnel
Many https site will keep the tunnel active even after finished loading. Doing this can make our proxy spawn too many threads without exiting them
Our Solution: close the tunnel automatically after a certain amount of time has passed, thereby exiting the thread created

6. Malicious Users
Malicious user can create numerous fake request to our proxy in an attempt to overload the server
Possible Solution: use re-captcha service to identify real user from the fake ones

7. Badly formatted request
Request that contains special characters that the browser sent which when parsed will return illegible hostname which causes error when seting up socket
Our Solution: ignore such cases by actively filtering out the request sent by Browser

8. Buffer size error
Response received may be greater than the maximum size that a vector can hold, which causes buffer overflow. Or the response could be empty, manipulating it can cause M_Range error.
Our solution: check the number of bytes received, if it's 0, we will not try to manipulate it. if it is about go exceeds the maximum size, we discard the response.

9. Error when opening file 
Log file may fail to open, which makes the subsequent action with log impossible
Our Solution: use is_open to detect if the log file being opened, if not, we will throw an exception which will be caught by the code which called log and retry

##########Caching Policy##########
Map can only contain a maximum of 100 cached response. Once the cache size is exceeded, a random cached entry will be deleted to make room for the new entry.  We check the expiration state of the cached response when the same url has been requested, if the response has expired, we revalidate and update the response.
