1. Transmission Error:
Occurs when receiving large amount of data from the websites, the proxy may not rececive all the transmitted bytes in one go
Our Solution: use a while loop to wait until no more transmission is made, meanwhile attach every message received in to a new buffer

2.Cache Size
Since we store the cached request into the memory, too many cached request may cause memory overflow
Our solution: max cache size limited to 100 responses, new cache will replace the existing ones when the map is full

3.Cache in multiprocessing
multiple processes may want to write into the cache at the same time, causing data races
Our solution: Using mutex lock to lock the map while one process is writing

4. Invalid request format
Browser constanly sending ill-formatted request which the proxy is not designed to handle
Possible soution: config the browser to stop it from sending such request, set up rules in our proxy to ignore such requests
